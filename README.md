# Object-Oriented-Programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into reusable, modular units. OOP promotes encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to make code more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand.
